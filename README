To use this source, import the project into Flash Builder 4.6. 

Since Whack! was built with the [Starling Framework][1], you will need to reference Starling. To do that, either link to the Starling SWC or add a source path pointing to the "src" directory of Starling. 

This version was built with Starling 1.1; if you can't compile it due to a change in Starling, download and use this version until we have updated the code.

Look in the media directory for some of the asset files and tools I used to make the project.
